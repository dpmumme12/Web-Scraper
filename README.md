<h3>CS50W Final Project</h3>

==Description==

For my final project I wanted to take the opportunity to leanr how to webscrape with Python's Beautifulsoup module. It is a movie searcher where you can that uses Imdb data to search for movies and also uses Rotten tomato data to recieve the movie ratings. I made sure to be careful not to violate the websites scraping policies by using Python's Robotpaser module to make sure I adhere to their robot.txt. Javascript is used to add a movie of the user's choosing to their watchlist. I believe this meets the requirements of the project as it is exploring a different technology taught from the class that is highly usable to further expand my knowledge of web programming.
